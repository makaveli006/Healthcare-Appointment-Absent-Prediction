# Client vs Service Provider in Medical ERP Projects

## Who is the Client?
A **medical ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) solution provider** is a company that develops and supplies integrated software systems specifically for healthcare organizations to manage their clinical, administrative, and financial operations.

### What Medical ERP Solution Providers Do
They build platforms that help hospitals, clinics, and healthcare networks manage:
- Patient administration (registration, scheduling, billing)
- Electronic Medical Records (EMR/EHR) integration
- Appointment and resource scheduling
- Billing, insurance, and revenue cycle management
- Inventory and pharmacy management
- Staff and payroll management
- Reporting, compliance, and analytics

These systems bring multiple hospital or clinic functions into one centralized software solution.

### Who They Serve
Their customers are typically:
- Hospitals
- Clinics and outpatient centers
- Diagnostic labs
- Healthcare networks

### Examples of Medical ERP Solution Providers
- Epic Systems
- Cerner (Oracle Health)
- SAP Healthcare
- Allscripts
- MEDITECH
- Smaller regional or custom healthcare ERP vendors

## In Your Project Context
When you say:
> “Our client, a medical ERP solutions provider…”

It means:
- The company owns and maintains healthcare ERP software
- They want to add a machine learning feature (predicting patient no-shows)
- They are hiring or engaging another party (the service provider) to build that ML capability

**So, the medical ERP solution provider is the software company, not the hospital or doctor.**

## Who is the Service Provider?

The **service provider** is the individual or team (such as a data scientist, ML engineer, or consulting firm) hired to develop and integrate the machine learning model into the ERP system.

## Who are the Medical Providers?
**Medical providers** are the organizations and professionals who deliver healthcare services directly to patients. They use the ERP software to manage their operations and benefit from features like patient no-show prediction.

### Examples of Medical Providers
- Hospitals
- Clinics
- Outpatient centers
- Diagnostic labs
- Doctors, nurses, and other healthcare staff

Medical providers are the end users of the ERP system and its machine learning features.
